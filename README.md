Google Photos - Drive sync
===========================

## Why?

We love to store all of our photos in Google Photos.

We like to have them also available in Google Drive, so we can manage them in a folder like 
structure and sync them with our local storage.

I used to have a manically curated folder structure, with dates and events for my
photo archive, but in Google Drive all the photos, no matter if they are in an album
are seen with the <year>/<month> structure, nothing more. Not nice!

This script purpose is to sync the Google Photos album structure to Google Drive,
useful and easy.
